The problem statement and data is from a **kaggle competition**. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/overview) to go to the competition page. It is a machine learning task to predict a movie's worldwide box office revenue - it is a regression problem. The data analysis notebook gives an in depth analysis of the data. Also, I use some additional data available on public platforms. The second notebook tries out different models to predict revenue.

The **report.pdf** is an overall summary of the complete project.
